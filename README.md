# Yamler

Yamler is the editor for everybody who needs to frequently write and share yaml.
It doesn't store the entered text anywhere but in the URL, so you can copy and paste the URL anywhere to share the yaml content.

Yamler uses the [ace editor](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace)

Give it a try at https://yamler.ntlx.org
